All biological systems involve intricate inter-cell coordination. Most of these cells use the same array of seemingly simple actions to achieve wildly different and complex results. This coordination needs to robust and precise to make multicellular life feasible. \\

This thesis will be a study in simulating how emergent phenomena at multiple different [smth]-scales help form morphogenesis. Focusing on fruit fly gastrulation, we we will be proposing a biologically founded, agent-based model with a minimal rule-set. We will through both qualitative and quantitative analyses examine the model's capabilities and shortcomings, with special focus on whether any global information not contained in initial conditions are needed for arriving at dynamics akin to what is observed in vivo. Finally, the model will be used to probe different morphogenetic events, seeing how their complex interplay are vital in shaping the animal to come.
