Questions:

Is the neighborhood search a part of the model or simply a computational tool?

How are the hyperparameters found? beta = 5 etc.



Meeting notes:
DONE - Less noise (1e-5)
DONE start with sphere - elongate at a later point
Add angle!  a.b > 0
DONE - dont find neighbors every step (jax.lax.cond)
DONE - better IC on sphere. Unit vectors are not homogenenous


Meeting notes:
TODO:
Set Lambda3 to the correct value
initial conditions PCP pointing around
non symmetric \lambda3 in x (genius!)


TODO:
lav asymmetrisk
Append/overwrite!
Automatic density
Look at abs(S3) instead of S3

TODO:
Alpha!
Neurolation
Run loong time
find way to document


TODO:
p_hat normalized?


To show:
right!: Large_angle_correct
wrong:  line_egg
