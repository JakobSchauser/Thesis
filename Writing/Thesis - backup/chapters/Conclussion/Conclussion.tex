\section{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Polarizations only set from initial conditions. Sufficient to be kept by simple, biologically founded rules
    \item No explicit timing
    \item No chemotaxis
    \item No large-scale "information sharing"
    \item Stable under perturbations
    \item Genetic parsing is predictive for phenotypes from     
    \item With a p-value of
