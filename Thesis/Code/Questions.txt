Questions:

Is the neighborhood search a part of the model or simply a computational tool?

How are the hyperparameters found? beta = 5 etc.



Meeting notes:
DONE - Less noise (1e-5)
DONE start with sphere - elongate at a later point
Add angle!  a.b > 0
DONE - dont fing neighbors every step (jax.lax.cond)
DONE - better IC on sphere. Unit vectors are not homogenenous
